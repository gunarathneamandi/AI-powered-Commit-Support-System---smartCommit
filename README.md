## AI-Powered Commit Support System

This project focuses on developing an AI-powered Commit Support System designed to enhance and automate the commit message generation process in software development. The system addresses the challenges of inconsistent formatting, unclear descriptions, and non-compliance with company standards often found in manually written commit messages. By leveraging Artificial Intelligence and Machine Learning techniques, the system aims to:

* **Automate Commit Message Generation**: Generate high-quality, standardized commit messages based on code changes (diffs), ensuring they align with company standards and provide meaningful context[cite: 57, 60, 84].
* **Provide Next Word Prediction**: Offer real-time suggestions to assist users in manually writing commit messages, enhancing clarity and adherence to best practices[cite: 25, 86, 226].
* **Offer Commit History Insights**: Implement features to help teams analyze patterns, track changes, and facilitate bug fixing and maintenance through detailed explanations of past commits[cite: 26, 58, 87, 232, 233].
* **Enforce Organizational Rules**: Dynamically apply and ensure commit messages comply with project-specific and company-defined guidelines[cite: 605, 606, 623, 222].
* **Improve Developer Productivity**: Reduce the manual effort involved in composing commit messages, allowing developers to focus more on coding and streamlining the software development lifecycle[cite: 30, 59].

The system is built using modern front-end (React.js, Tailwind CSS) and back-end (FastAPI) technologies, supported by a structured database (MongoDB) and a vector database (FAISS) for semantic similarity searches. [cite_start]It incorporates advanced NLP techniques and fine-tuned Large Language Models (LLMs) such as Qwen2.5-Coder-1.5B-Instruct, LLaMA 3.3 70B Instruct, and Gemini-2.0-Flash LLM[cite: 27, 41, 42, 49, 116, 117, 123, 127, 241]. [cite_start]The development followed an Agile Scrum methodology[cite: 204].
